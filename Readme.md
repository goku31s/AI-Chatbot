## What we will cover?

In this project, Abhinav demonstrates:  
- Understanding the potential of **Generative AI**  
- Exploring **Generative AI Studio** in Google Cloud  
- Using the **Python SDK for Vertex AI / Generative AI API**  
- Building an AI-powered chatbot capable of **multi-turn conversation**  
- Incorporating **multi-modal input** (text + images)  
- Crafting a **Python Flask-based web chatbot app**  
- Dockerizing the chatbot app for **seamless deployment**  
- Deploying the containerized app on **Cloud Run**

## What is Generative AI

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can **create novel content** — text, code, or images — from instructions. It acts as a creative partner, capable of generating ideas, solving problems, and providing informative or insightful responses.

---

## Generative AI Studio in Google Cloud

**Generative AI Studio** is Google Cloud’s platform for experimenting with and customizing generative AI models. It allows developers to rapidly prototype, test, and deploy AI models, providing a console to visualize and refine AI outputs.

---

## Generative AI API

Google’s **Generative AI API** (Gemini/PaLM) provides access to large language models trained on extensive text and code datasets. These models are capable of:  
- Generating natural language text  
- Translating languages  
- Summarizing or analyzing content  
- Understanding and reasoning over **multi-modal input** (text + images)

---

## Vertex AI / Python SDK

The **Vertex AI Python SDK** and **`google-genai` library** provide programmatic access to Generative AI models. Using Python, developers can:  
- Send text and image inputs to the model  
- Receive AI-generated responses (full or streamed)  
- Maintain conversation history for chatbot applications  
- Integrate AI into applications or web interfaces

## About this Project

This project demonstrates how to:  
- Build a **multi-turn chatbot** that remembers conversation context  
- Incorporate **image input** so the chatbot can interpret visual data  
- Create a **Flask web app** for interactive user experiences  
- Dockerize the application for **reproducible deployment**  
- Deploy the containerized chatbot on **Cloud Run** for scalable, serverless hosting
